   `cd dir2opds`

1. Fork the repo.
1. Set your fork as a remote:

   `git remote add fork https://github.com/GITHUB_USERNAME/dir2opds.git`

1. Make changes and commit
   to your fork. Initial commit messages should follow the
   [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style (e.g.
   `feat(functions): add gophers codelab`).
